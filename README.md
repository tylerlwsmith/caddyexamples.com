# Caddy Server Examples

Caddy is an incredible webserver, but the documentation includes few examples. The intention of this site is to provide small examples that demonstrate as few concepts as possible so a user can discover what they need, understand the concept, and put the necessary code into their own project.

## Architecture

This site was built with the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/). You must have Hugo installed to run the site. It uses the [Paper theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-paper/), and the site overrides Paper's list page to remove the date.

## Examples

- Reverse proxy
- Variables
- PHP with file server. Explain that if using docker, static files must be on Caddy server
- Ports (localhost:80 vs port only syntax (:80))

## Launch

I will buy caddyexamples.com and launch the site once I have five examples done.
